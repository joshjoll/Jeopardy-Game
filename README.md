# Jeopardy-Game

Jeopardy is a long running trivia based TV show that allows contestants to compete in answering questions correctly. Contestants pick questions from different categories, each with different point value assigned to it. After the player picks a cell from the board, the answer to the question is revealed, and it is up to the player to provide the correct question.
