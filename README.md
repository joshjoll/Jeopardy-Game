# Jeopardy-Game

Jeopardy is a long running trivia based TV show that allows 3 contestants to compete in answering questions correctly. Contestants pick questions from different categories, each with different point value assigned to it. After the player picks a cell from the board, the answer to the question is revealed, and it is up to the player to provide the correct question.
